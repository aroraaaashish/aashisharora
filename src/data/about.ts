I'm a cybersecurity professional with a passion for securing systems, mitigating risks, and staying ahead of evolving threats. With a strong foundation in areas such as network security, vulnerability assessment, incident response, and threat intelligence, I focus on protecting digital assets and enabling secure innovation.

I stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies by reading industry blogs, research papers, and cybersecurity advisories. In my spare time, I build side projects, conduct security experiments, and explore new tools to sharpen my skills and deepen my understanding of offensive and defensive strategies.

Whether it’s hardening infrastructure, responding to incidents, or implementing proactive security measures, I bring a detail-oriented mindset, a strong ethical foundation, and a commitment to continuous learning.

Let’s connect—I’m always open to collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and exploring new challenges in the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape.
